[section {Appendix B. Configuration options}]

The [emph configure] script as generated by Autoconf will support a
number of standard configuration options as well as any that you define
for your extension via the [emph AC_ARG_WITH] and [emph AC_ARG_ENABLE]
macros.
[para]
The table below describes the standard configuration options (most of the
text is copied from B. Welch's book "Practical Tcl and Tk programming", 3rd edition)

[list_begin bullet]

--prefix=[emph dir]
[nl]
Defines the root of the installation directory - default: /usr/local.

[bullet]
--exec-prefix=[emph dir]

- default: the value of "--prefix".

[bullet]
--enable-gcc/--disable-gcc (default)

Use the [emph gcc] compiler instead of the native (enable) or use
the native compiler (disable).

[nl]
Turn multithreading support on (enable) or off (disable).

[bullet]
--with-tcl=[emph dir]

a number of Tcl versions or for more than one platform)

[bullet]
--with-tk=[emph dir]
[nl]
Specifies the directory where Tk was built

[bullet]
--with-tclinclude=[emph dir]
[nl]
Specifies the directory where the Tcl include files can be found (notably: tcl.h)

[bullet]
--with-tcllib=[emph dir]

[bullet]
--with-x11include=[emph dir]
[nl]
Specifies the directory where the X11 include files (such as X11.h) can be found (especially important
if these are not found in one of the usual places)

[bullet]
--with-x11lib=[emph dir]
[nl]
Specifies the directory where the X11 libraries (e.g. libX11.so) can be found

[list_end]

Note that all of these options come with reasonable defaults, so that you only
have to worry about them when the configure script terminates with some kind of
error.
