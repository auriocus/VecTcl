Design principles of VecTcl
--------------------------

VecTcl was designed in a way that integrates numerical computing tools as closely with Tcl as
possible. VecTcl was defined to adhere to these general objectives:

1. _Ease of use_ 
2. _Interoperability_
3. _Generality_
4. _No external dependencies_
5. _Performance_
